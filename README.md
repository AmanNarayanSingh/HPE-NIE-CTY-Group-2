# HPE-NIE-CTY-Group-2
GOLang library for HPE iLO Restful Operations

# How this idea matters to HPE: <br>
HPE is leader in server software which comprises of Integrated Lights out(iLO).  To manage iLO using Restful Redfish APIs, Golang library is the first step. Library should be independently used to develop new Golang tools to manage HPE servers.

# Phase 1
Objective:<br> Learning about Golang, Restful, Redfish, Client/Server etc.
Description:<br> 
The learning should include:<br>
•	What is Restful Architecture<br>
•	Basics of Golang.<br>
•	Basics of DMTF Redfish.<br>
•	Identify Tools needed like VS code/GoLand etc.<br>
•	Setting up development environment like ubuntu VM etc.<br>
•	Identify dependencies and design intended library.<br>

Deliverable:<br> Design document of Golang library for Rest/Redfish.<br>

So hereby I am attaching the ppt for the project understanding:<br> https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B4R3KPjgumXNBsLDlwrfHBF1gBGHn-pY/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111943377070889195268&rtpof=true&sd=true
<br>
Currently we are working with GET operation and soon we will be uploading the design document and code for get operation.
