# HPE-NIE-CTY-Group-2
GOLang library for HPE iLO Restful Operations<br>
(Team members: Aman Narayan Singh, Swathi BJ, Aditya Mishra, Shreesh Kulkarni)

# How this idea matters to HPE: <br>
HPE is leader in server software which comprises of <b>Integrated Lights out(iLO)</b>.  To manage iLO using Restful Redfish APIs, Golang library is the first step. Library should be independently used to develop new Golang tools to manage HPE servers.

# Phase 1
<b>Objective</b>:<br> Learning about Golang, Restful, Redfish, Client/Server etc.<br>
<b>Description:</b><br> 
<b>The learning should include:<b/><br>
•	What is Restful Architecture<br>
•	Basics of Golang.<br>
•	Basics of DMTF Redfish.<br>
•	Identify Tools needed like VS code/GoLand etc.<br>
•	Setting up development environment like ubuntu VM etc.<br>
•	Identify dependencies and design intended library.<br>

<h2>Deliverable:</h2><br> Design document of Golang library for Rest/Redfish.<br>
